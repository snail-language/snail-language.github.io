Version 1.3.0 of snail has been released.  This version adds a language server
feature, which allows IDEs to query snail for parsing and lexing errors.  This
version also contains minor bug fixes as described below as well as some internal
changes. You can download a copy from the [Downloads](/downloads#version-130)
page.

## [v1.3.0] - 2023-05-04
### Added
- Language server support (`-s` or `--server`) to support on-the-fly parsing and
  lexing error messages via a VSCode plugin (or other plugin)
- identifiers may now begin with `_` (underscore)
- Internal testing for the reference parser
### Changed
- Internally, the reference interpreter was refactored to use lightweight
  threads (Lwt)
### Fixed
- EOF while parsing now has a dedicated error message
- Resolved bug with array accesses not updating the store correctly
