Snail (or more formally, the *Strings Numbers Arrays and Inheritance Language*),
is a dynamically typed, expression-based, object-oriented programming language
that is simple enough to be implemented in a one-semester course. 

Snail is developed and maintained by [Kevin
Angstadt](https://github.com/kevinaangstadt), who is a Professor of Computer
Science at St. Lawrence University. Course instructors are encouraged to reach
out for access to the reference interpreter.

## Similarity to Other Languages

Snail is heavily influenced by the COOL programming language created by Alex
Aiken and modified by Wes Weimer.  Any good ideas in the language should be
attributed to Alex and Wes, while all mistakes and shortcomings are solely
Kevin's fault. A notable difference, however, is that snail is dynamically typed
whereas COOL uses static typing and is *type safe*.
