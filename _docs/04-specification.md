## Lexical Structure
The lexical structure is designed to be fairly simple to implement.  There are
some deviations from popular programming languages (e.g., handling of escape
sequences); these are typically to reduce the burden of implementing lexical
analysis.

### Integers
Integers are non-empty strings of digits 0-9.  It is a lexer error if the a
literal integer constant is too big to be represented as a 64-bit signed
integer. 64-bit signed integers range from $$-2^{63}$$ to $$2^{63}-1$$.

### Identifiers
Identifiers are strings (other than keywords) that conform to [Unicode's
identifier specification](https://unicode.org/reports/tr31/).  In particular,
snail uses the "XID" identifier specification.

Both variable names and class names are treated as identifiers in snail.
Notably, keywords, are treated separately from identifiers.

### String Literals

Strings are enclosed in double quotes (i.e., "..."). Snail only recognizes two
*escape sequences*, `\"` and `\\`, during lexing.  This allows double quotes to
be embedded in a string literal and a backslash to be the last character in a
string.

```js
"Grace Hopper said, \"A ship in port is safe, but thatâ€™s not what ships are built for.\""
```

Two escape sequences are handled by the `IO` module: `\n` and `\t`.  These are
not interpreted or transformed by the lexer in any way.

Note that escape sequences *are not converted* to a single character.  They are
left as a `\` followed by the next character.  This will simplify lexing and
interpretation, but differs from other languages.

```js 
class Main : IO {
    main() {
        print_string("She said, \"What?\"");
    };
};

// outputs: She said, \"What?\"
```

Strings may not contain the null character (with integer value 0).  Newline
characters and carriage returns are also not allowed.  All other characters 
are allowed.

Strings must have an opening and closing quote.  The lexer must reject source
code that contains malformed strings.

### Comments
Line comments begin with `//` and continue to the next newline (or end of file).

Block comments are also supported using `/* ... */` syntax.  Block comments may
be nested and must be terminated before the end of file.

### Keywords
The following identifiers are treated as keywords in snail:
* `class`
* `else`
* `if`
* `isvoid`
* `let`
* `new`
* `while`
* `true`
* `false`

All keywords in snail are *case insensitive*. That is, any capitalization of a 
keyword is still treated as a keyword.  

### Whitespace
Snail follows the definition of whitespace provided by the [Unicode
specification](https://unicode.org/charts/collation/chart_Whitespace.html).

### Operators and Punctuation
Refer to [Langauge Basics](/docs/language-basics) or [SL-LEX Format](#sl-lex-format) for additional lexemes in the language.

## Snail Syntax

The snail language syntax is provided below using an EBNF grammar.  Tokens are
indicated by single quotes and are named using [SL-Lex token
names](#sl-lex-format) or character constants.  Parentheses are used for
grouping, and regular expression operators have the usual meanings (i.e., `*`
means zero or more times, `+` means one or more times, and `?` means zero or one
times).

{% highlight conf %}
program ::= (class)+
class   ::= 'class' 'ident' (':' 'ident')? '{' (feature)* '}' ';'
feature ::= 'let' 'ident' ('=' expr)? ';'
          | 'ident' '(' ('ident' (',' 'ident')*)? ')' block ';'
expr    ::= 'ident' '=' expr
          | expr '[' expr ']' '=' expr

{% endhighlight %}

Next, we describe each section of this grammar in detail. The snail grammar may
also be represented using [syntax
diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram) as shown below.

### Programs

![](/assets/svg/program.svg){: .program-rr}

Programs consist of one or more classes.

### Classes
![](/assets/svg/class.svg){: .class-rr}

Classes are named by an identifier, contain zero or more features wrapped in
curly braces, and are terminated by a semicolon.  
Additionally, an optional identifier may be provided to indicate inheritance.

It is a parse error if any of the following identifiers (case sensitive) are
used for a class name:
- `Array`
- `Bool`
- `Int`
- `IO`
- `String`
- `Object`

It is also a parse error if any of the following identifiers (case sensitive)
are used for an inherited class name:
- `Array`
- `Bool`
- `Int`
- `String`

Inheritance parse errors should be reported on the colon (`:`) rather than the 
identifier.

### Features
![](/assets/svg/feature.svg){: .feature-rr}

Features can be either be *member variables* or *methods*.  A member variable
may either be initialized or uninitialized.  All features are terminated by
semicolons.

It is a parse error to name a member variable `self`.  

### Expressions
![](/assets/svg/expression.svg){: .expression-rr}

Expressions make up the majority of the snail grammar.  The individual behavior
of each expression type is described on the [Language
Basics](/docs/language-basics) page.  

It is a parse error to name a local variable `self`.

It is a parse error for the identifier following the square brackets in a `new-array` expression to be anything but `Array` (case sensitive).

### Blocks
![](/assets/svg/block.svg){: .block-rr}

Blocks wrap a sequence of expressions---each terminated by a semicolon---in
curly braces.  Blocks are defined separately in the grammar because they are
used in method definitions, `if` expressions, and `while` expressions.

It is a parse error for a block to be empty.
  
### Precedence
The precedence of operations, from highest to lowest, is given in the following
table.

| Operator(s)   | Associativity | Precedence |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| `.`           | none          | *highest*  |
| `@`           | none          |            |
| `~`           | none          |            |
| `[`           | left          |            |
| `*` `/`       | left          |            |
| `+` `-`       | left          |            |
| `<` `<=` `==` | none          |            |
| `!`           | none          |            |
| `=`           | none          | *lowest*   |

### Line Numbers
The line number for an expression is the line number of the first token that is
part of that expression.

For example:
{% highlight js linenos %}
while ( x <=
              99 ) {
  x = x + 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `while` expression is on line 1, the `x <= 99` expression is on line 1, the
`99` expression is on line 2, the `{ x = x + 1; }` block expression is on line
2, and both the `x = x + 1` and `x + 1` expressions are on line 3.

## Data Representation
Every value in snail is an object.  Objects contain a list of member variables
(or *attributes*).  Additionally, each object belongs to some class defined in
the language specification or program source code. This documentation uses the
following syntax to denote values in snail:

$$X(a_1 = l_1, a_2 = l_2, \ldots, a_n = l_n)$$

$$X$$ is the class associated with the value, which contains attributes (member
variables) $$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$, and each of these attributes is located at an
*abstract* memory location specified by $$l_1, \ldots, l_n$$.  This implies that
there is space reserved in memory for each of the the member variables in this
object.

Built-in object types in snail (i.e., `Array`, `Bool`, `Int`, `String`) use a
special version of the syntax above. The attributes of these classes cannot be
modified directly, so we do not specify the locations of each attribute, but
rather their exact values:

* $$Array(3, [X(\ldots), X(\ldots), X(\ldots)])$$: An `Array` contains its size and
  the array of values.
* $$Bool(true)$$: A `Bool` contains its Boolean value.
* $$Int(5)$$: An `Int` contains its integer value.
* $$String(5, \texttt{"snail"})$$: A `String` contains its length and contents.

## Operational Semantics
The operational semantics of snail define the value produced by each of the
different expression types in the language, given a particular context. A
context consists of three elements: the "self" object, an environment of
in-scope variables, and a store of all live variables.

We present these rules semi-formally.  Note that our presentation specifies
*behavior* but does not describe an explicit *implementation*.

### Environment and Store
The *environment* is a mapping of variable identifiers to *abstract* memory
*locations*. That is, the environment tells us where in memory each variable is
stored.  In a valid snail program, each identifier used in an expression will be
contained within the environment.  For example, the expression `a + b` will only
be valid in a context with an environment containing mappings for `a` and `b`.

We will use the following notation to describe the contents of an environment:

$$E = \left\lbrace a : l_1, b : l_2 \right\rbrace$$

This environment maps `a` to location $$l_1$$ and `b` to location $$l_2$$.

The *store* is a mapping of abstract memory locations to *values*. Values in
snail are objects.  That is, the store tells us what object is associated with
each memory location. We will use the same notation for both stores and
environments:

$$S = \left\lbrace l_1 : Int(1), l_2 : Int(2) \right\rbrace$$

This store maps $$l_1$$ to an integer object containing 1 and $$l_2$$ to an
integer object containing 2.

Together, the environment and store allow us to model variables in program
execution. The double indirection allows for a decoupling of scope and memory,
which is needed to support object that exist on the heap and that can be
aliased.

Given some environment and store, the value of a variable can be determined by
first looking up the location of the variable's identifier in the environment
and then looking up the value at this location in the store.

$$\begin{aligned}
E(a) &= l_1 \\
S(l_1) &= 1
\end{aligned}$$

Assignments require replacing a value in the store, but do not affect the
environment mapping. For example, assigning 45 to `a` would require updating the
value stored at $$l_1$$.

$$\begin{aligned}
E(a) &= l_1\\
S' &= S\left[ 45 / l_1 \right]
\end{aligned}$$

The syntax, $$S\left[v/l\right]$$ denotes constructing a new store, $$S'$$ that
is identical to $$S$$ except that $$S'$$ maps location $$l$$ to value $$v$$. The
remaining locations remain unchanged.  Similar notation my be used to introduce
variables into an environment.

We will also use the function $$newloc(S)$$ to find an unused location in a
given store.  The location returned by $$newloc(S)$$ will be *fresh*, meaning
that there exists no mapping in $$S$$ for this location.

### Typing Rules
Before executing, the AST will be checked for any cycles in the inheritance of
classes in the program. If a cycle is found, this will produce a runtime error
on line 0 of the program.

Snail is a *dynamically* typed language.  The type of any variable is the type
of data most recently assigned to it.  Similarly, the type of any expression is
the type of the value produced by evaluating that statement.

To ensure the correctness of evaluating a snail program, types of certain
expressions must be checked as part of the expression evaluation process. These
checks are listed below.

#### Arrays
* An array access may only be performed on a value of type `Array`
* The value of the index in an array access must be of type `Int`
* When constructing an `Array` the type of the size must be an `Int`


#### Dispatch (Method Calls)
* Dispatches may not occur on `void` objects
* The name of the method must exist in the specified object
* The number of arguments provided must match the number of parameters in the
  method definition
* In a static dispatch, the type specified must exist in the program
* In a static dispatch, the type specified must be the current class or an
  ancestor class

#### Conditionals and Loops
* The value produced by the predicate guard must be of type `Bool`

#### Arithmetic
*  All values on arithmetic operations must be of type `Int`

#### Logical Operations (not)
* The value in the expression being negated must be of type `Bool`

#### Built-In Class Methods
* The type of the argument to `Object.is_a` must be `String`
* The type of the argument to `String.concat` must be `String`
* The type of both arguments to `String.substr` must be `String`
* The type of the argument to `IO.print_string` must be `String`
* The type of the argument to `IO.print_int` must be `Int`

### Operational Rules
The operational rules of snail are presented using [big-step operational
semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_semantics).  The rules are
written using the following form:

$$\frac{\vdots}{so,E,S \vdash e_1 : v, E', S'}$$

This rule may be read as: Given the *self* object $$so$$, environment $$E$$, and
store $$S$$, the expression $$e_1$$ evaluates to object $$v$$, producing a new
environment $$E'$$ and store $$S'$$.  The dots above the horizontal bar stand
for other statements abut the evaluation of sub-expressions of $$e_1$$.

The value $$so$$, which is part of the context of each of these rules, is the
value that is bound to the identifier `self` in any sub-expression of $$e_1$$.
The environment and store produced by evaluating $$e_1$$ ($$E'$$ and $$S'$$,
respectively) contain all changes to the memory and current in-scope variables
resulting from side effects of expression evaluation.

The remainder of this section briefly discusses each of the operations rules. To
simplify notation, we present the evaluation rules of snail in a mixture of
these formal semantics and written prose.


#### Assignment
An assignment first evaluates the expression on the right-hand side, yielding
value $$v_1$$.  This value is stored in memory at the location specified for the
identifier.

$$\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : v_1, E_1, S_1\\
E(Id) &= l_1\\
S_2 &= S_1\left[v_1/l_1\right]
\end{aligned}}{so,E,S \vdash Id = e_1 : v_1, E_1, S_2}\mbox{[Assign]}$$

An array assignment first evaluates the expression on the right-hand side,
producing value $$v_1$$.  Then, the expression on the left-hand side
representing the array is evaluated.  Finally, the index expression on the
left-hand side is evaluated.  The value $$v_1$$ is then stored in the array
value at the offset indicated.

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : v_1, E_1, S_1\\
so,E_1,S_1 &\vdash e_2 : Array(l,arr), E_2, S_2\\
so,E_2,S_2 &\vdash e_3 : Int(i), E_3, S_3\\
0 \leqslant &i \leqslant l\\
arr[i] &= v_1
\end{aligned}}{so,E,S \vdash e_2[e_3] = e_1 : v_1, E_2, S_2}\mbox{[Array-Assign]}
$$

#### Identifiers, Array Accesses, and Constants
The rules for identifier references, `self`, array accesses, and constants are
straightforward. Note that the array object is evaluated prior to the index
value for array accesses.

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
E(Id) &= l_{id}\\
S(l_{id}) &= v
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash Id : v, E, S}\mbox{[Identifier]}
$$

<br>

$$
\frac{}
{so,E,S \vdash self : so, E, S}\mbox{[Self]}
$$

<br>

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : Array(l, arr), E_1, S_1\\
so,E_1,S_1 &\vdash e_2 : Int(i), E_2, S_2\\
0 \leqslant &i \leqslant l\\
v &= arr[i]
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash e_1[e_2] : v, E_2, S_2}\mbox{[Array-Access]}
$$

<br>

$$
\frac{}
{so,E,S \vdash true : Bool(true), E, S}\mbox{[True]}
$$

<br>

$$
\frac{}
{so,E,S \vdash false : Bool(false), E, S}\mbox{[False]}
$$

<br>

$$
\frac{i \text{ is an integer}}
{so,E,S \vdash i : Int(i), E, S}\mbox{[Int]}
$$

<br>

$$
\frac{\begin{array}{c}
s \text{ is a string}\\
l = length(s)
\end{array}}
{so,E,S \vdash s : String(l, s), E, S}\mbox{[String]}
$$

#### Blocks
Blocks of expressions are evaluated from the first expression to the last
expression. The result is the result of the final expression.  Blocks introduce
a new scope.  The resulting scope (environment) is the same as the original
scope prior to execution.

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : v_1, E_1, S_1\\
so,E_1,S_1 &\vdash e_2 : v_2, E_2, S_2\\
&\vdots\\
so,E_{n-1},S_{n-1} &\vdash e_n : v_n, E_n, S_n
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash \left\{e_1; e_2; \cdots; e_n; \right\} : v_n, E, S_n}\mbox{[Block]}
$$

#### Conditionals and Loops
The evaluation rules for conditionals and loops are fairly standard. Note that
the value of the predicate is a `Bool` object rather than a boolean. The `while`
loop produces a `void` value.

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : Bool(true), E_1, S_1\\
so,E_1,S_1 &\vdash e_2 : v_2, E_2, S_2
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash if (e_1)\; e_2\; else\; e_3 : v_2, E_2, S_2}\mbox{[If-True]}
$$

<br>

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : Bool(false), E_1, S_1\\
so,E_1,S_1 &\vdash e_3 : v_3, E_2, S_2
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash if (e_1)\; e_2\; else\; e_3 : v_3, E_2, S_2}\mbox{[If-False]}
$$

<br>

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : Bool(true), E_1, S_1\\
so,E_1,S_1 &\vdash e_2 : v_2, E_2, S_2\\
so,E_2,S_2 &\vdash while (e_1)\; e_{body} : \texttt{void}, E_3, S_4
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash while (e_1)\; e_{body} : \texttt{void}, E_3, S_4}\mbox{[While-True]}
$$

<br>

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : Bool(false), E_1, S_1\\
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash while (e_1)\; e_{body} : \texttt{void}, E_1, S_1}\mbox{[While-False]}
$$

#### Local Variable Introduction (Let)
Local variables are introduced into a scope with the `let` expression.  First,
the initializer is evaluated and assigned to a fresh location.  If there is no
initialization, the variable is assigned `void`.

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : v_1; E_1, S_1\\
l_{Id} &= newloc(S_1)\\
S_2 &= S_1\left[v_1/l_{Id}\right] \\
E_2 &= E_1\left[ l_{Id} / Id  \right]
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash let\; Id = e_1 : v_1, E_2, S_2}\mbox{[Let]}
$$

#### Void Value Checks (`isvoid`)
Checking for a void value requires evaluating the expression to see if the value
is `void`.

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : void, E_1, S_1\\
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash isvoid(e_1) : Bool(true), E_1, S_1}\mbox{[IsVoid-True]}
$$

<br>

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : X(\ldots), E_1, S_1\\
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash isvoid(e_1) : Bool(false), E_1, S_1}\mbox{[IsVoid-False]}
$$

#### Arithmetic Operations
The `Int` type in snail represents 64-bit two's complement signed integers.
Arithmetic operations are defined accordingly.

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : Int(i_1), E_1, S_1\\
v_1 &= Int(-i_1)
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash  {\sim} e_1 : v_1, E_1, S_1}\mbox{[Negate]}
$$

<br>

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : Int(i_1), E_1, S_1\\
so,E_1,S_1 &\vdash e_2: Int(i_2), E_2, S_2\\
op &\in \left\{+, *, -, /\right\}\\
v_1 &= Int(i_1\; op\; i_2)
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash e_1 \; op \; e_2 : v_1, E_2, S_2}\mbox{[Arithmetic]}
$$

#### Comparisons
Our notation is not sufficient to fully capture the semantics of all
comparisons. Where needed, we will augment our discussion with written
descriptions.

Negations are straight-forward.

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : Bool(b), E_1, S_1\\
v_1 &= Bool(!b)
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash !e_1 : v_1, E_1, S_1}\mbox{[Not]}
$$

For $$e_1 = e_2$$, first $$e_1$$ is evaluated and then $$e_2$$. The two values
(objects) are compared for equality by first checking the locations of each
value. If these locations are the same, then the values are the same.  The value
`void` is not equal to any object except itself.  If the two objects are both of
type `String`, `Bool`, or `Int`, their respective contents are compared.

The comparison operators $$<$$ and $$<=$$ are handled similarly.  The case for
integers can be captured with our operational semantics.

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : Int(i_1), E_1, S_1\\
so,E_1,S_1 &\vdash e_2: Int(i_2), E_2, S_2\\
op &\in \left\{<, \leqslant\right\}\\
v_1 &= \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{ll} 
  Bool(true), & \text{if}\; i_1\; op\; i_2\\ 
  Bool(false), & \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} 
\right.
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash e_1 \; op \; e_2 : v_1, E_2, S_2}\mbox{[Comparison-Int]}
$$

Values of type `Bool`, and `String` also admit comparisons.  For booleans,
`false` is defined to be less than `true`.  For Strings, comparisons are
performed using the standing UTF-8 string ordering (e.g., `abc` $$<$$ `xyz`).
Any other comparison returns `false` if the values are not equal.

#### New Objects
Instantiating a new object requires allocating new memory locations for each
member variable (attribute).  Initially, the value for each of these attributes
is set to `void`.  Then, each attribute is initialized in turn.  If an attribute
does not have an initializer, *do not* evaluate an assignment expression for it
in the last step.

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
class(T) &= (a_1 = e_1, \ldots, a_n = e_n)\\
l_i &= newloc(S), for\; i = 1 \dots n\; and\; each\; l_i\; is\; distinct\\
v_1 &= T(a_1 = l_1, \ldots, a_n = l_n) \\
S_1 &= S\left[\texttt{void}/l_1, \ldots, \texttt{void}/l_n\right] \\
E_1 &= {a_1 : l_1, \ldots, a_n : l_n} \\
v, E', S' &\vdash \left\{ a_1 = e_1; \cdots; a_n = e_n \right\} : v_1, E_2, S_2
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash new\; T : v_1, E, S_2}\mbox{[New]}
$$

To construct an array, the size is first evaluated.  An empty array of this size
is then allocated and returned.  All elements in the array are `void`.

$$
\frac{\begin{aligned}
so, E, S &\vdash e_1 : Int(i), E_1, S_1\\
v &= Array(i, [\texttt{void}_1, \ldots, \texttt{void}_i])
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash new[e_1]\; Array : Array(l, arr), E_1, S_1}\mbox{[New-Array]}
$$

#### Dispatch

Dispatches make use of a recursive procedure, `lookup_method(X, f)`, which
searches the AST of the program beginning with class `X` for a method with name
`f`. If the method definition is not found in `X`, then the procedure recurses
to the parent class of `X`.

In all dispatches, the argument expressions are evaluated in order before
allocating new locations. Arguments are passed by value in snail.  Note however,
that this is a *shallow* copy (the attribute locations remain the same).  This
can be thought of as copying the *reference* to the object (as in Java).

Attributes are added to the calling environment before arguments to ensure that
proper masking is performed.

A *dynamic* dispatch evaluates the target expression *after* evaluating
arguments. The type of the target value is used for method lookup.

$$

$$

A *static* dispatch also evaluates the target expression *after* evaluating the
arguments; however, the type statically specified is used for the method lookup.
The type of the target must be in a subclass relationship with the static type
specified.

$$

so,E,S &\vdash e_1 : v_1, E_1, S_1\\
so,E_1,S_1 &\vdash e_2: v_2, E_2, S_2 \\

so,E_{n-1},S_{n-1} &\vdash e_n : v_n, E_n, S_n\\
so,E_n,S_n &\vdash e_0 : v_0,E_{n+1},S_{n+1}\\
v_0 &= X(a_1 = l_{a_1}, \ldots, a_m = l_{a_m})\\
X &\leqslant T \\
lookup\_method(T,f) &= \left\{params: \left[x_1, \ldots, x_n\right], body: e_{body}\right\} \\
l_{x_i} &= newloc(S_{n+1}), for\; i = 1 \dots n\; and\; each\; l_{x_i}\; is\; distinct\\
E_{dispatch} &= \left\{ a_1 : l_{a_1}, \dots, a_m : l_{a_m}, x_1 : l_{x_1}, \ldots, x_n : l_{x_n}  \right\} \\
S_{n+2} &= S_{n+1}\left[ v_1/l_{x_1}, \ldots, v_n/l_{x_n} \right] \\
v_0,E_{dispatch},S_{n+2} &\vdash e_{body} : v_{ret}, E_{ret}, S_{n+3}
\end{aligned}}
{so,E,S \vdash e_0@T.f(e_1, \ldots, e_n) : v_{ret}, E_{n+1}, S_{n+3}}\mbox{[Static-Dispatch]}
$$

In a *self* dispatch, the self object does not change when evaluating the body
of the method.

$$

The behavior of dispatches on instances of built-in classes are defined on the [Built-In Classes](/docs/classes) page.

#### Runtime Errors
There are several other runtime errors that snail should check while executing:

* Division by zero
* Dispatch on a `void` value
* Attempting to access an unbound (possibly out-of-scope variable)
* Array indices fall outside the bounds of the allocated space
* Arrays cannot be copied using `Object.copy`
* `String.substr` indices must be within the bounds and length of the string
* While not an error, Array indices are only guaranteed to be valid in the range
  $$0 \leqslant i \leqslant 2^{30}$$

In all of these cases, a runtime error should be generated, and the program
should flush output and exit.

Stack and heap overflows are platform-dependent.
## Interchange Formats
The snail specification provides formats for serializing tokens and abstract
syntax trees.  These formats designed to be simple to parse either manually or
using common tools.

### SL-LEX Format
The SL-LEX format is used to save a sequence (stream) of tokens to a file.
Files with the `.sl-lex` suffix follow a simple serialization format.

Each token is represented by a triple (or quadruple) of lines. The first line
holds the line number.  The second line holds the column number. The third line
gives the name of the token. The optional fourth line holds additional
information (i.e., the lexeme) for identifiers, integers, and strings.

#### Line and Column Numbers
The first line in a file is line 1. Each successive newline character (`\n`)
increments the line count. Column numbers begin with column 1 and resets on each
newline.

#### Example
Given the following input:

{% highlight js linenos %}
Backslash !
   "allowed"
{% endhighlight %}

The corresponding SL-LEX output is:
```
1
1
ident
Backslash
1
11
not
2
5
string
allowed
```

Note that the lexeme for a string literal does not include the double quotes,
and thus the column number is that of the first character of the string itself.

The table below maps tokens to their SL-LEX name.

| SL-LEX name         | Token    |
| -----------         | -------- |

### SL-AST Format
The SL-AST format is used to save an abstract syntax tree representing a
syntactically valid snail program to a file.  Files with the `.sl-ast` suffix
are formatted using [JSON](https://www.json.org), a common data interchange
format supported by many programming languages.

A snail AST is structured as an `array` of JSON `object` elements, each
representing a class in the source program.  Beyond requiring proper nesting of
object (and the correct ordering of arguments and parameters), SL-AST does not
specify a particular ordering of parameters in objects, order of features in
classes, or order of classes in a program.  It is generally good practice to 
maintain the same order as the source snail program, however.

#### Formal Specification
SL-AST is formally specified by a JSON *schema*.  The most recent version of the
schema is available [here](/assets/sl-ast.schema.json).  Any number of JSON
schema validator tools may be used to verify the conformity of an SL-AST file to
this specification.

#### Informal Specification
The following is an informal discussion of each of the object types found in an
SL-AST file.  The formal specification should be referenced for precise
descriptions.

##### Classes

The following object structure is used to define a class:

```json
{
    "class_name": < name of class >,
    "inherits": < name of class to inherit from >,
    "members": [ < array of member objects > ],
    "methods": [ < array of method objects > ]
}
```

The `class_name`, `members`, and `methods` properties are required.

##### Members

The following object structure is used to define a member variable:

```json
{
    "name": { < identifier object of the variable name > },
    "type": "member",
    "init": { < expression object of the initializer value > }
}
```

The `name` and `type` properties are required.

##### Methods

The following object structure is used to define a method:

```json
{
    "name": { < identifier object of the method name > },
    "type": "method",
    "parameters": [ < array of identifier objects > ],
    "body": { < expression object of the body > }
}
```

All properties are required.  Note that
the `body` property will always be a `block` expression.


##### Identifiers

The following object structure is used to define an identifier:

```json
{
    "line": < integer line number >,
    "col": < integer column number >,
    "value": < string of the identifier name >
}
```

All properties are required.  The line and column numbers are positive and
one-indexed.  They always refer to the first character in the lexeme associated
with the token.

##### Expressions

The following object structure is used to define an expression:

```json
{
    "line": < integer line number >,
    "col": < integer column number >,
    "value": { < expression_value object > }
}
```

All properties are required.  The line and column numbers are positive and
one-indexed.  They always refer to the first character of the first lexeme
associated with the expression.  The `value` property will be one of several
valid objects described below.

##### Expression Values

The following expression values are supported.  All properties are required
unless otherwise noted.

* Assignment Expression (`id = exp`)
  ```json
  {
      "type": "assign",
