### Testing Locally

To configure your machine to test changes locally, follow the directions on the following sites and play around (TODO Charlie used a combination of these sites and is not sure which actually got the job done. Figure out which of them actually do the thing)
- [Installing Ruby](https://mac.install.guide/ruby/13.html)
- [Some random blog](https://pengyizhang.github.io/2020/03/18/jekyll/)
- [KBroman blog](https://kbroman.org/simple_site/pages/local_test.html)

To test changes to your changes locally, run the following commands

```
bundle exec jekyll build
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

and navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) in your favorite web browser.
